🐔 This was a difficult assignment. Openweathermap did not make their 
    documentation easy
🐔 It took a lot of referencing and getting my URL correct to get it to display.

🐔I accidentally broke the script more times than I care to admit before 
    things started to work.

🐔I could not get the last searched city to load despite tying around 8  
    different things.

🐔It broke once I got the forecasts to change with the cities and nothing I 
    could find would fix it, so I used the HTML to set a default.
